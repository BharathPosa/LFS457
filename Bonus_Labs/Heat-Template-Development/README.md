Exercise 11.4 Develop a Heat template including the following features
(i) Neutron networking
(ii) Attach Cinder volume to a Nova instance.
Overview:
This exercise will help to develop a basic template to deploy a single compute instance using neutron networking
feature. And also help to attach a created Cinder volume to a Nova instance.
Task 1: Create a template with neutron networking feature, create and attach Cinder volume to a Nova instance
Task 2: Launch the developed template
Task 3: List the Stack for status
Task 4: Query the status of Stack
Task 5: List the Stack resources
Task 6: Open Horizon to observe the created neutron network and Cinder volume attachment to a Nova instance
Required Setup:
OpenStack Environment with Deployed Heat Service.
