###Exercise 11.4 Develop a Heat template including the following features###

###(i) Neutron networking###

###(ii) Attach Cinder volume to a Nova instance.###

####Overview:####

This exercise will help to develop a basic template to deploy a single compute instance using neutron networking feature. And also help to attach a created Cinder volume to a Nova instance.

**Task 1**: Create a template with neutron networking feature, create and attach Cinder volume to a Nova instance

**Task 2**: Launch the developed template

**Task 3**: List the Stack for status

**Task 4**: Query the status of Stack

**Task 5**: List the Stack resources

**Task 6**: Open Horizon to observe the created neutron network and Cinder volume attachment to a Nova instance


**Required Setup**:

OpenStack Environment with Deployed Heat Service.
